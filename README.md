In this project, I implemented two deep learning models to classify images: a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a pre-trained InceptionV3 model. The CNN model achieved a training accuracy of 85%, demonstrating reasonable performance on the dataset. However, the validation accuracy indicated some overfitting, suggesting that the model struggled to generalize well on unseen data.

In contrast, the InceptionV3 model, which leverages a more advanced architecture and pre-trained weights, significantly outperformed the CNN model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 93%. 

Overall, the results indicate that while a basic CNN can provide a good baseline, leveraging more advanced models like InceptionV3 can dramatically improve performance, particularly on challenging datasets.
